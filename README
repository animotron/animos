Hello there.

It is a repository for Phantom OS userland code and cross-development tools.
de-facto it contains kernel sources as well, though.

Code, contained here, is not all we have for Phantom - we upload only
those parts of code which are more or less ready to be co-developed.

Basically, most of code we (the original team) upload is very straighforward
and, sometimes, dumb. That, to some extent, is on purpose. We want to have
a working system first and polish it next. Besides, not all the concepts and
design desicions are final, so it is of no use to finalize all the 
implementation desisions now as well.

Code is known to compile successfully with cygwin/linux gcc 4.3.4.
Only ia32 target is ok, arm port is not finished.

Best regards, Dmitry Zavalishin,
Phantom project... how to say... inventor? :)
