Hello there.

It is a repository for Phantom OS userland code and cross-development tools.

Code, contained here, is not all we have for Phantom - we upload only
those parts of code which are more or less ready to be co-developed.

Basically, most of code we (the original team) upload is very straighforward
and, sometimes, dumb. That, to some extent, is on purpose. We want to have
a working system first and polish it next. Besides, not all the concepts and
design desicions are final, so it is of no use to finalize all the 
implementation desisions now as well.

Please visit http://groups.google.com/group/phantom-os and join us to discuss
what can you do for the project.

The original code was created under cygwin environment, so it needs some
tailoring to continue development in Linux or MacOS. If someone wants to do that - 
you're welcome.


Best regards, Dmitry Zavalishin,
Phantom project... how to say... inventor? :)
