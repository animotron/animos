Hello there.

It is a repository for Phantom OS userland code and cross-development tools.
de-facto it contains kernel sources as well, though.

Code, contained here, is not all we have for Phantom - we upload only
those parts of code which are more or less ready to be co-developed.

Basically, most of code we (the original team) upload is very straighforward
and, sometimes, dumb. That, to some extent, is on purpose. We want to have
a working system first and polish it next. Besides, not all the concepts and
design desicions are final, so it is of no use to finalize all the 
implementation desisions now as well.

Code is known to compile successfully with cygwin/linux gcc 4.3.4.
Only ia32 target is ok, arm/mips/amd64 port are not finished.



BUILD

  make all in trunk

RUN

  Run phantom.cmd/phantom.sh in trunk/run

DEBUG

  Run QEMU (see above) and then - gdb in trunk/oldtree/kernel/phantom

  Kernel console is saved to trunk/run/serial0.log 

  Kernel is able to send logging info to syslogd by UDP.
  Currently syslogd address is hardcoded in net_misc.c.
