NB! Kernel is not available now, so QEMU part can be skipped.

0. You will need cygwin on Windows. Everything here was not tested
   on Unix, but generally is very Unix-friendly.

1. set PHANTOM_HOME env var to point to this directory.

2. set PHANTOM_TFTP env var to point to tftp directory your 
   QEMU will serve tftp contents from.

3. Edit config.mk

4. make install

5. type "pvm_test.exe" and press Enter. Phantom Windows test environment 
   must start and show some fancy background and some shit over it.

For Windows-based Phantom code test and debug the path is:

1. Make sure you have all classes you import compiled in plib/bin. Just
   come to that dir and make. No dependencies are set up between .pc 
   files so, it is possible, you will need to make 3 or 4 times of compile
   some .ph files yourself. Use "plc file.ph" to compile .ph source file.
   Result comes to plib/bin automatically.

2. Make sure you have "classes" file made in plib/bin. Just "make" after
   all the required .pc files are there.

3. Run pvm_test.exe. See ru.dz.phantom.system.boot.ph to understand
   startup sequence.
