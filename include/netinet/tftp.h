THE TFTP PROTOCOL (REVISION 2)
http://spectral.mscs.mu.edu/RFC/rfc1350.html

  TFTP supports five types of packets, all of which have been mentioned
   above:

          opcode  operation
            1     Read request (RRQ)
            2     Write request (WRQ)
            3     Data (DATA)
            4     Acknowledgment (ACK)
            5     Error (ERROR)

   The TFTP header of a packet contains the  opcode  associated  with
   that packet.
