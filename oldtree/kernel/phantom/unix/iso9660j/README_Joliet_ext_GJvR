Updated iso9660 CDROM driver

November 1998 by Gertjan van Ratingen


I had some CDROMS in my collection which were made with only
Joliet extensions (these are extensions to the ISO9660 filesystem,
just like RockRidge is; this enables e.g. longer filenames than the
default 8 characters of ISO9660).

Sadly the iso9660 driver of BeOS R3.2 didn't understand joliet extensions.
Being a BeOS developer, and wanting that feature bad enough, I grabbed
the iso9660.zip archive, along with the sources of mkhybrid-4.48a and
several joliet patches for Linux (thanks to Marco Nelissen for these ;-)

After some nice digging into the wonderful world of poorly documented
software, I now have a driver which handles the Joliet extensions good
enough for my use.


Installation:
- 'make' to compile the driver using the makefile;
  (don't forget to copy/link
   /boot/beos/system/kernel_mac to /boot/develop/lib/ppc/_KERNEL_
   or /boot/beos/system/kernel_x86 to /boot/develop/lib/x86/_KERNEL_.LIB)
- 'make install' to install the driver
- insert your favorite CDROM and mount it...


Some notes:
- iso.h, iso.c and kernel_interface.c have changed;
  search for "JOLIET" to find the changes.
- the sources in this archive are for BeOS PPC R4;
  a version for BeOS R3 PPC is available upon request.
- if a disc has both Joliet and RockRidge extensions, the Joliet ones
  will be used.


Things to do:
- decent Unicode16 -> UTF8 conversion
  maybe use (from support/UTF8.h) convert_to_utf8(...)
  (currently the driver assumes each 16bit Unicodechar has MSB 0, and LSB = ASCII-code)
- Test, test, test.
