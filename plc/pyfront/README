Very preliminary Python frontend for Phantom. It is supposed that
this stage will convert pyton source to intermediate representation
which will be picked up by plc backend and compiled to Phantom bytecode
in a usual way.

Requires cygwin (or, possibly, any other) python (tested with 2.5.2-1).
