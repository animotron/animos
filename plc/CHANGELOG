Version 0.32
------------
Changed syntax to accept string constant as a class name component.
Was needed to be able to define class names such as "class" (same as
language keywords).

Improved array and new() type checks.

Version 0.33
------------
Fixed method call sequence error (o.m1().m2()).
Added ability to import classes using string constants
as name elements (import .internal."class";)
Made type of 'new' expression to be known if possible.
Added graceful death in case of uninitialized int access 
attempt. Will be exception soon, of course.

Version 0.34
------------
Fixed inheritance - it was impossible to access parent's variables
and methods from child.
Added missing 'null' keyword. :)
